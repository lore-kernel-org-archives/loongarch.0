The cleanup looks good to me, thanks!

I'm currently unable to verify though, because my loongarch box 
currently has an RX 6400 plugged in which won't get initialized by the 
firmware (likely related to newer x86 emulation capability required by 
the card's VBIOS) so I can't see the efifb. I'll swap that card out 
maybe this week to test this (and the other "Reprobe after parsing 
config tables" patch) though!
