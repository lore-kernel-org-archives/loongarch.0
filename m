Sorry for the delay — it turned out my ebizzy command was wrong. I had
been running `ebizzy -t <vcpus> -S 10`, which is neither -m nor -M, so
neither mmap mode was active and the workload wasn't really stressing
the TLB-flush path. Thanks for catching it.

I re-ran with -m and -M on host and a single VM (8-core LoongArch
KVM host, 8 vCPU guest, 1:1, no overcommit).

                 ebizzy -m        ebizzy -M
host             ~20,000          ~55,000
VM (8 vCPU,1:1)  ~17,000          ~53,000
VM/host          ~86%             ~97%

The -m ratio (86%) is close to your 76%.

I then tried multi-VM overcommit (2 and 3 VMs, all running ebizzy -M
simultaneously). The initial result showed a large gap between the
PV-TLB-flush kernel and the baseline under overcommit. Both kernels
have CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled (PV IPI and steal-time are active in
both), so PV TLB flush should be the main differentiator — but since
they are two separate kernel images rather than a clean on/off toggle,
there may be some noise from other differences. I'm now re-running
with a QEMU CPU property (kvm-pv-tlb-flush on/off) on the same kernel
to isolate the effect cleanly.

I'll share the verified numbers once I have them.

Thanks,
Tao
