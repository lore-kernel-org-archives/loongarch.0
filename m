Given what
https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/08_Processor_Configuration_and_Control.html#processor-container-device
says, and what QEMU does (as I detailed in my reply to Gavin), I think
this should be:

"Qemu TCG describes CPUs using processor devices in a processor
container."

which uses the same terminology as the ACPI specification. Maybe also
including a reference to the above URL would be a good idea too?
