I didn't look into your patchset very carefully, but I doubt you
are reinventing the wheel. X86 didn't have FDT, seems it introduces FDT
for KHO support. LoongArch doesn't have FDT, so you reworks the EFI
transport. Is there a reason you don't want to follow the standard KHO
way using FDT too?

Please correct me if I am wrong.
