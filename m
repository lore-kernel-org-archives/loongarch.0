[Severity: High]
Could unmasking interrupts before registering the shared handler create a
race condition?

Because writel(SE_INT_ALL, se->base + SE_S2LINT_EN) is called earlier in
loongson_se_probe() to unmask interrupts, registering a shared interrupt
handler here means that if node 1's interrupts are unmasked, it could
instantly assert the shared IRQ line.

Since node 1 hasn't fully registered its handler yet, node 0's handler might
return IRQ_NONE, causing the kernel to repeatedly receive an unhandled
interrupt and eventually disable the IRQ line.



[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but might the new use of IRQF_SHARED expose an
uninitialized completion object in the interrupt handler?

The completion structures for the engines are zero-allocated via
devm_kzalloc() in loongson_se_probe() and are only initialized later in
loongson_se_init_engine().

If a pending or spurious engine interrupt fires on the shared line before
the child engine devices are fully initialized, the handler will execute:

se_irq_handler()
    ...
    while (int_status) {
        id = __ffs(int_status);
        if (id < SE_ENGINE_MAX)
            complete(&se->engines[id].completion);

Calling complete() here on a zeroed structure dereferences a NULL
wait.head.next pointer, which could cause a kernel panic.

[Severity: Critical]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does the probe error path leak
running hardware state?

loongson_se_init() configures the hardware to use the allocated DMA memory
and sends SE_CMD_START. If devm_mfd_add_devices() fails here, the probe
returns an error and devres frees the DMA memory.

However, the hardware is never sent SE_CMD_STOP in the error path. It
remains active and retains a pointer to the freed DMA memory, which could
allow it to corrupt system memory via DMA.



[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but are hardware interrupts left globally
enabled if probe fails or the device is removed?

loongson_se_probe() unconditionally enables all hardware interrupts earlier
via writel(SE_INT_ALL, se->base + SE_S2LINT_EN). If devm_mfd_add_devices()
fails, the probe function returns an error and the IRQ handler is
unregistered, but the hardware interrupts are never masked.

Similarly, loongson_se_remove() stops the controller but fails to write 0
to the interrupt enable register.

Because the IRQ is shared, a pending interrupt from this device could
continuously trigger the shared IRQ line without a registered handler to
clear it, causing an unhandled interrupt storm that forces the kernel to
permanently disable the IRQ line.

While reviewing the completion handling in this driver, I noticed a couple
other pre-existing issues outside the scope of this diff:



[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does re-initializing the
completion variable after triggering the hardware create a race condition?

Looking at loongson_se_send_engine_cmd():

loongson_se_send_engine_cmd()
    ...
    loongson_se_poll() // triggers hardware and reenables interrupts
    ...
    reinit_completion(&engine->completion);
    ...
    wait_for_completion_interruptible(&engine->completion);

If the hardware completes the command quickly after loongson_se_poll()
unmasks interrupts, it triggers an interrupt. The handler will call
complete(), but then execution resumes in loongson_se_send_engine_cmd()
where reinit_completion() clears the completion state.

This would cause the subsequent wait_for_completion_interruptible() to hang
indefinitely since the completion event was lost.



[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but could missing completion re-initialization
cause controller commands to falsely return success?

Looking at loongson_se_send_controller_cmd():

loongson_se_send_controller_cmd()
    ...
    // hardware triggered
    return wait_for_completion_interruptible(&se->cmd_completion);

The function waits on the completion without first calling
reinit_completion() to clear any leftover state.

If a previous wait was interrupted by a signal (returning -ERESTARTSYS),
the hardware may still complete later, leaving a positive done count in
the completion structure. On the next call to
loongson_se_send_controller_cmd(), wait_for_completion_interruptible()
would immediately consume the leftover count and return success before the
new hardware command has actually finished. This could break serialization
and corrupt hardware or DMA state.
