Sorry for not getting to this earlier; $DAY_JOB is taking its toll on my 
Linux contributions these days.

IMO, it's probably better to keep the definitions for documentation 
purposes.

As a Loongson employee, you may be aware of the fact that your company's 
"official" documentation is often lacking, and this information you're 
removing is not found elsewhere. So for preserving this knowledge, 
either (1) ask your documentation people to properly record these 
information in official docs then you can go ahead removing them here, 
or (2) just keep the content here if (1) isn't doable for any reason. 
You do want 3rd-parties to freely develop on your platforms, making full 
use of the products' capabilities, don't you? ;-)
