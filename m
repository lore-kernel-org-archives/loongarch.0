Right. You don't actually have to list them all *in the driver* though,
just in the binding and in the devicetree. I think what you have missed
is:

This is what you would put in the compatible section of a devicetree
node, using "fallback compatibles". So for a ls1c you put in
compatible =3D "loongson,ls1c-rtc", "loongson,ls1b-rtc";
and the kernel first tries to find a driver that supports
"loongson,ls1c-rtc" but if that fails it tries to find one that supports
"loongson,ls1b-rtc". This gives you the best of both worlds - you can
add support easily for new systems (when an ls1d comes out, you don't
even need to change the driver for it to just work!) and you have a
soc-specific compatible in case you need to add some workaround for
hardware errata etc in the future.

Right, but it has been merged - you are deleting the driver that supports
it after all - which means that any dtb with the old compatible will
stop working.
I don't disagree with Krzysztof that having wildcard based compatibles
is bad, but I do not think that regressing rtc support for systems with
these old devicetrees is the right way to go either.

Thanks,
Conor.
