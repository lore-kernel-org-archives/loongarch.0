Sorry, I didn't describe it clearly, The divisor I described doesn't 
refer to
the fixed 1/2 factor feeding MISC block(including I2C). What I have 
described
is included in the formula in section 10.2 of the 7a1000 user manual.

Prcescale = clock_a/(clock_div*clock_s)-1

clock_a represents the input clock(it is the fixed 1/2 factor feeding 
MISC block
(including I2C), 50M on 7a1000), which is described by "clocks",
clock_s represents the i2c bus frequency, which is described by 
"clock-frequency",
The divisor I described is clock_div in formula. which has different 
value on
different platform. for example, it is 5 on 7a1000/7a2000, 4 on 
2K1000/2K2000,
5.5 on 2K3000. I need a property to describe clock_div in this formula.
