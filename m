To be fair, this isn't a ping or a resend. It's addressing comments that
were given in v8 that was sent out on Tuesday.

This isn't v1, where I would agree with waiting a week for comments. v1 was
sent back in 3/6. I do not expect (nor want) someone to wait a week on v8
for all feedback to come in, unless it was a redesign of the code. But it's
now starting to settle, and that "week waiting" period isn't necessary for
fixing up minor suggestions by the reviewers.

I was hoping this would be good to go by the end of the week, so I could
get it into linux-next by next week.
