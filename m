On this point sure, I would argue less so around the fork stuff but I responded
on that specifically elsewhere so let's keep things moving :>)

Again, as I said elsewhere, I think there might be a 3rd way possibly. It's a
big mistake to assume that there are only specific solutions to problems in the
kernel then to present a false dichotomy.

We absolutely hear you on this being a problem and it WILL be addressed one way
or another.

Of the two approaches, as I said elsewhere, I prefer what you've done in this
series to anything touching fork.

But give me time to look through the series please (I'd also suggest RFC'ing
when it's something kinda fundamental that might generate converastion, makes
life a bit easier on the review side :)

Yep aware, we spoke in Zagreb about this, and on this thread, we know :)

Again as per above, let's not impose a false dichtomy, let's take our time, and
specifically - please give me time to read through the series and think about
this.
