After thinking it through, the introduction and initialization of
thread_struct.reg02 (including the assignment in INIT_THREAD and
p->thread.reg02 = (unsigned long)p; in copy_thread()) are redundant
and should be removed. The reasons are as follows:

1. Direct update in __switch_to: In __switch_to within switch.S, the
    hardware $tp register is updated directly from the next argument
    (via register a1) using "move tp, a1".

2. No restoration path: The cpu_restore_nonscratch macro does not
    include any restoration logic for reg02. This means no assembly
    or C code ever reads thread_struct.reg02 across the entire context
    switch path, whether standard or non-standard.

3. Exception/Syscall recovery relies on per-CPU variables: At exception
    and system call entry points (e.g., in stackframe.h and entry.S),
    the recovery of the kernel-space $tp relies entirely on the per-CPU
    variable __entry_task, which is already properly and explicitly
    updated during entry_task_switch() and CPU initialization.

Consequently, reg02 is a classic piece of dead code (write-only, never
read), and trimming this field would keep the architecture code clean.

Regarding the explicit zero-initialization, it is redundant in modern
kernel development.

For static structures like init_task, any uninitialized fields are
automatically zeroed out by the compiler according to the C standard.
Stripping away dozens of lines of ".field = 0" complies with modern
Linux kernel code-cleaning standards. It makes the macro much shorter
and highlights the only field that actually requires a special
runtime value (the kernel stack top in .reg03).

For reference, please see how INIT_THREAD is defined in other major
architectures, where they only initialize what is strictly necessary:

x86
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
#define INIT_THREAD  {							  \
	.sp0			= TOP_OF_INIT_STACK,			  \
	.sysenter_cs		= __KERNEL_CS,				  \
}

#else
extern unsigned long __top_init_kernel_stack[];

#define INIT_THREAD {							\
	.sp	= (unsigned long)&__top_init_kernel_stack,		\
}

#endif /* CONFIG_X86_64 */

arm64:
#define INIT_THREAD {				\
	.fpsimd_cpu = NR_CPUS,			\
}

riscv:
#define INIT_THREAD {					\
	.sp = sizeof(init_stack) + (long)&init_stack,	\
	.align_ctl = PR_UNALIGN_NOPRINT,		\
}

Therefore, a cleaner and more accurate approach is to drop
reg02 entirely and adopt the slimmed-down INIT_THREAD for
LoongArch.

Regarding the suggestion to keep the custom current_pt_regs() macro
under CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, it must be completely removed.
Keeping it would be fundamentally incorrect and dangerous for the
following reasons:

1. It becomes logically incorrect:

The old macro relies on aligning up the $sp to the top of the stack
via bitwise operations to locate the exact position of pt_regs.

With CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK enabled, the thread_info is moved
off the stack, and the strict coupling between the masked SP and
the absolute position of pt_regs is broken (especially if features
like VMAP_STACK are enabled in the future, where stacks are no
longer naturally aligned to THREAD_SIZE).

Keeping this macro will cause current_pt_regs() to return a
corrupted/incorrect pointer, leading to inevitable kernel panics
or silent data corruption.

2. No real performance benefit:

Once CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is selected, current is simply
the hardware $tp register. Fetching pt_regs via task_pt_regs()
just compiles down to loading the stack pointer from $tp with
a single memory access, followed by a constant offset adjustment.

This is extremely fast and efficient on LoongArch, and it avoids
multiple ALU operations (or, add, sub) required by the old
SP-masking macro.

3. Alignment with other architectures:

Other major architectures (such as x86, arm64, and riscv) all
completely dropped their custom SP-masking current_pt_regs()
implementations when moving to THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, relying
instead on the standard, safe, and generic task_pt_regs()
provided by the core kernel wrapper.

Therefore, this custom macro is both broken and insecure under
the new standard, and it must be removed to ensure kernel
stability and clean code alignment with upstream.

Regarding the suggestion for stackframe.h:

Looking at the original macro context, this is an excellent and
completely feasible assembly optimization.

By moving the __entry_task restoration right after the preservation
of u0, we can advance the "csrrd u0, PERCPU_BASE_KS" instruction and
reuse the loaded u0 register directly for the LONG_ADD on SMP platforms.
This completely eliminates the need for a duplicate csrrd instruction
inside the #ifdef CONFIG_SMP block.

The optimized code block would look like this:

         beqz    t0, 9f

         cfi_st  u0, PT_R21, \docfi
         csrrd   u0, PERCPU_BASE_KS

         la_abs      t1, __entry_task
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
         LONG_ADD    t1, t1, u0
#endif
         LONG_L      tp, t1, 0

Thank you for catching this! I will gladly incorporate this assembly
optimization into the next version.

Regarding the suggestion to rename and move __entry_task and
entry_task_switch():

Thank you for the suggestion, but after checking the upstream
kernel implementation, the current naming and placement are
actually fully aligned with the multi-architecture standards
established by ARM/ARM64.

A quick grep in the kernel tree reveals that ARM and ARM64
uses the exact same pattern:

$ grep -rn entry_task arch
arch/arm/kernel/process.c:40:DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct task_struct *, 
__entry_task);
arch/arm/include/asm/switch_to.h:31:		__this_cpu_write(__entry_task, 
next);			\
arch/arm/include/asm/thread_info.h:40:DECLARE_PER_CPU(struct task_struct 
*, __entry_task);
arch/arm/include/asm/assembler.h:357:	ldr_this_cpu	\t1, __entry_task, 
\t1, \t2
arch/arm64/kernel/process.c:609:DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct task_struct *, 
__entry_task);
arch/arm64/kernel/process.c:611:static void entry_task_switch(struct 
task_struct *next)
arch/arm64/kernel/process.c:613:	__this_cpu_write(__entry_task, next);
arch/arm64/kernel/process.c:777:	entry_task_switch(next);
arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:223:	ldr_this_cpu	tsk, __entry_task, x20
arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:1033:	ldr_this_cpu	dst=x0, sym=__entry_task, 
tmp=x1

As we can see:
1. Moving to current.h is heavily avoided: Both ARM and ARM64 place
    these definitions in process.c or switch_to.h, rather than
    current.h. <asm/current.h> is a highly sensitive, low-level header
    included almost everywhere. Putting per-CPU macros there would pull
    in <linux/percpu.h> and <linux/sched.h>, inevitably triggering
    catastrophic circular header dependency compile errors.

2. "__entry_task" and "entry_task_switch" are the precise industry
    standards: Rather than adopting UML's historical naming style,
    following the ARM64 conventions makes the code much more canonical
    and easier for cross-architecture developers to maintain.
    It clearly expresses that this per-CPU pointer is strictly
    dedicated to the exception entry path for task recovery.

3. "set_current()" causes mental friction: Across the generic kernel,
    "current" is universally treated as a read-only concept. Introducing
    a set_current() helper might mislead developers into thinking they
    can modify the active task pointer at will, whereas
    "entry_task_switch" explicitly limits its semantics to the context
    switch boundary.

Therefore, I prefer to keep the current naming and structure in
switch_to.h to remain consistent with ARM64 and keep the header
dependencies perfectly clean.

Regarding the suggestion to keep tp_value in thread_info:

You are completely right. I walked into a misunderstanding that
tp_value was strictly coupled with the kernel-space $tp tracking.
Since its true purpose is to preserve the user-space TLS value
for the LBT (Loongson Binary Translation) extension context,
it should definitely be decoupled from this THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK
migration.

I will follow the "one patch does one thing" principle and keep
tp_value untouched in struct thread_info to avoid breaking any
future or existing LBT TLS logic.

Thank you for clarifying this! I will restore this field in the
next version.

Regarding the suggestion to keep the flags initialization:

You are completely right. Modifying the default flags (changing
_TIF_FIXADE to 0) is an unrelated side-effect that goes beyond
the scope of migrating thread_info.

Changing this could alter the alignment error fixing behavior
for the initial idle task and cause unexpected regressions.

I will follow your advice, leave the flags logic untouched,
and only remove the deleted ".task = &tsk" member.

Thank you for your critical review!

Regarding the feedback on process.c and thread_struct:

Actually, after double-checking the core architecture assembly,
we don't need to worry about where to place
"p->thread.reg02 = (unsigned long)p;"
because this line can be completely deleted, and reg02 shouldn't
be added to thread_struct at all.

As analyzed previously, during context switch, the hardware $tp
register is updated directly from the C argument "next" via
"move tp, a1".

Furthermore, the cpu_restore_nonscratch macro contains absolutely
no logic to read or restore reg02. This means thread_struct.reg02
has a write-only path and is never read anywhere (even for new
processes or kernel threads). To keep the architecture code clean
and avoid misleading future developers, I will completely drop
reg02 and its assignment from the next version.

Placing entry_task_switch(&init_task) at the very end of
setup_arch() leaves a massive window during early initialization
where __entry_task remains NULL.

If any early exception, interrupt, or panic occurs before the end
of setup_arch(), the exception entry path will load a NULL pointer
into $tp, triggering an immediate double-fault and completely
blinding the kernel's ability to print stack traces.

Moving it immediately after unwind_init() ensures that the $tp
recovery mechanism is armed as early as possible, providing robust
exception handling support during the rest of the boot sequence.

I will absolutely adopt this suggestion and move it right after
unwind_init() in the next version. Thank you!

Regarding the suggestion to move entry_task_switch() in smp.c:

You are completely right, and this is another critical catch for
early boot stability, this time on the secondary CPU path.

Placing entry_task_switch(current) after complete(&cpu_running)
leaves a dangerous window during the early C entry of
start_secondary() where the secondary CPU's __entry_task remains
uninitialized (NULL). If any early exception or kernel panic
occurs during the secondary CPU initialization prior to the
completion signal, the exception entry path will load a NULL
pointer into $tp, inducing an immediate double-fault and
completely blinding the kernel's early SMP debugging
capabilities.

Moving it immediately after cpu_probe() ensures that the
secondary CPU arms its $tp recovery mechanism at the earliest
possible stage in its C entry path.

I will absolutely adopt this suggestion and move it right
after cpu_probe() in the next version. Thank you!

Regarding the suggestion for (TASK_STACK - TASK_STRUCT_OFFSET)
in switch.S:

Thank you for bringing this up! With the definition of
TASK_STRUCT_OFFSET in mind:

#ifdef CONFIG_64BIT
#define TASK_STRUCT_OFFSET 0
#else
#define TASK_STRUCT_OFFSET 2000
#endif

This is an incredibly sharp and critical catch for 32BIT
architecture compatibility.

I will update this line to:
"LONG_LPTR       t0, tp, (TASK_STACK - TASK_STRUCT_OFFSET)"
in the next version.

This is the incremental diff based on the original patch:
