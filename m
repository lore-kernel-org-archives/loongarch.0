FYI: with this approach the build no longer instantly dies with binutils 
2.40 + gcc 12.3, but there are also tons of warnings that say the model 
attribute is being ignored. I checked earlier discussions and this means 
modules are silently broken at runtime, which is not particularly good UX.

But after more thought, I find it possible to not regress UX nor 
explicitly check for Clang: the special point about Clang is that it 
emits explicit relocs *without* support for the CLI -mexplicit-relocs 
flag. So assuming:

* CC_HAS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS means "-mexplicit-relocs" is supported by $CC,
* CC_EMITS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS means explicit relocs are emitted by $CC, 
with -mexplicit-relocs in CFLAGS if supported,

We then have:

* gcc 12.x: !CC_HAS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS && !CC_EMITS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS
* gcc 13.x: CC_HAS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS && CC_EMITS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS
* clang: !CC_HAS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS && CC_EMITS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS

So in this case (inside the AS_HAS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS=y block), as long as 
CC_EMITS_EXPLICIT_RELOCS we are okay. We can $(error) out in the first 
case and provide helpful diagnostics too.

What do you people think about this alternative approach?
