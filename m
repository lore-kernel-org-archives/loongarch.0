Hi Conor:

I seem to understand what you are talking about.
I hadn't delved into "fallback compatibles" before, so thanks for the
detailed explanation.

In fact, I have thought before if there is a good way to do it other
than adding comptable to the driver frequently, and "fallback
compatibles" should be the most suitable.

So in the dt-bindings file, should we just write this:

  compatible:
    oneOf:
      - items:
          - enum:
              - loongson,ls1c-rtc
          - const: loongson,ls1b-rtc
      - items:
          - enum:
              - loongson,ls2k0500-rtc
              - loongson,ls2k2000-rtc
          - const: loongson,ls7a-rtc
      - items:
          - const: loongson,ls2k1000-rtc

Thanks.
