I had the same question, so I asked AI. Here's what it says:

--- 8< ---

The bug was reported and tested using the KHO self-test runner
(tools/testing/selftests/kho/vmtest.sh), which builds a test kernel
using make olddefconfig with only a minimal set of CONFIG_* options.
Crucially, CONFIG_NUMA is not enabled.

When CONFIG_NUMA is disabled:

    #ifndef CONFIG_NUMA
    static inline void memblock_set_region_node(struct memblock_region *r, int nid)
    {
    }
    
    static inline int memblock_get_region_node(const struct memblock_region *r)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    #endif


struct memblock_region does not even contain an nid member.

memblock_set_region_node() is a no-op (the NUMA_NO_NODE argument is
simply discarded), and memblock_get_region_node() is hardcoded to always
return 0.

There is only one node (nid = 0), so for_each_node_state(nid, N_MEMORY)
loops once for nid = 0.

Both memblock_phys_alloc_range() and memblock_phys_alloc() mark their
allocations with MEMBLOCK_RSRV_KERN. Therefore, when
scratch_size_node(0) runs after allocating the lowmem scratch buffer,
memblock_get_region_node(r) returns 0 for that lowmem scratch buffer,
and r->flags & MEMBLOCK_RSRV_KERN is true. As a result,
scratch_size_node(0) counts the lowmem scratch area as part of Node 0's
kernel footprint and scales it by scratch_scale (200%) again.

--- >8 ---

I didn't look closer, but it does seem to make sense.

But in practice, this problem is only on CONFIG_NUMA=n and I don't think
in practice KHO or LUO is being used in non-NUMA systems. So while I
think it is worth fixing, I think we should also have a test where we
enable CONFIG_NUMA.

Your system probably has CONFIG_NUMA=y and that's why you aren't able to
reproduce this bug.

I think on NUMA systems the problem is the other way round. The
calculation for the global scratch also counts per-node allocations.

So I think the proper fix for scratch sizing is what this patch does and
then a fixup for the global scratch calculation as well.
