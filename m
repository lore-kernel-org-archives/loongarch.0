Sorry, but this is yet another illustration why the kernel process is
broken. Clearly, people do NOT bother reading what is actually written,
but instead make up in their minds something completely different.

This is *NOT* RFC v2. This is RFC v2:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/E1qgnh2-007ZRZ-WD@rmk-PC.armlinux.org.uk/

And what I wrote was "changes **** SINCE **** RFC v2". For those who
find English difficult, this means that what follows is the list of
changes that are in THIS posting that WERE NOT IN THE PREVIOUS POSTING
which was RFC v2.

Thanks for making me even more frustrated than I was.

Yet another reason why the kernel process is just completely broken.
"appears to be". Even when the changes are spelled out. Yes, right,
people don't have time to read. If that's the case, then it's a
waste of time adding a change log. It's a waste of time to add a
commit message. In fact, it's a total waste of time trying to
contribute to a rotten-to-the-core open source project that Linux
seems to have turned into.
