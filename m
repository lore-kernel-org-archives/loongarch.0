OK.

Got it, add .set_fmt callback for DAI ops in new version.

OK, replaced with a switch statement in new version.

You are right, PCI bus has a fixed clock.

On loongson 7A2000/2K2000 chips, the I2S controller has PCI configuration
address space, IO address space, and memory address space, it works as
a PCI device, but it's not a standard PCI device.

Its clock signal comes from the APB bus or AIX bus, not from PCI bus.
Currently, there is no good support from clock subsystem, the frequency of
the I2S controller's driver clock is a fixed value.

On 2K1000LA chip, the i2s controller is a platform device, it's supported
by another driver. My original purpose was to export an API to initializing
hardware.
It's OK to move this to specific I2S driver.

OK, the driver split into PCI driver and DMA driver in new version.

Fixed. Return directly.

Fixed. Check the number of periods before initializing the descriptor array.

Yes, remove the condition check.

No, we can request the interrupt just once.

As one DMA controller controls the transmission of audio data in one direction
(playback or capture), it is associated with a substream.
The operation requesting interrupt is placed in .pcm_construct callback of
snd_soc_component_driver in new version.

OK, replaced in new version.
