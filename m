So does this mean that on x86, the CPU object is instantiated only
when the hardware level hotplug occurs? And before that, the object
does not exist at all?

Because it seems to me that _STA, having both enabled and present
bits, could already describe what we need here, and arguably, a CPU
that is not both present and enabled should not be used by the OS.
This would leave room for representing off-line CPUs as present but
not enabled.

Apologies if I am missing something obvious here - the whole rationale
behind this thing is rather confusing to me.
