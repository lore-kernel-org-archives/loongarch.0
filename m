I don't think these instructions can be used in any systematic way
within a Linux userspace in 2023.  IMO they should not exist in
LoongArch at all because they have all the same disadvantages of Intel
MPX; MPX has been removed by Intel in 2019, and LoongArch is designed
after 2019.

If we need some hardware assisted memory safety facility, an extension
similar to ARM TBI or Intel LAM would be much more useful.


Back in the old MIPS-based Loongson CPUs, similar instructions (GSLE,
GSGT, etc.) were included in LoongISA extension and the manual says they
raises "address error" when assert fails.  So SIGSEGV seems the
"backward compatible" (quoted because we absolutely don't need to
maintain any backward compatibility with old MIPS-based implementations)
thing to do.
