I don't think any of the above has to do with anon vmas.  Does any anon
vma handling have anything to do with your problem?

This would be needed if anon vmas were being faulted while being
unmapped or merged?  Do we really need a fast path for that?  Note that
anon vmas cannot be merged if the vma chain... you know what, I wonder
how many people know what I'm talking about here... Let's just say that
they can't be merged if they were around for a fork.

So, then, we're looking at anon vmas taking the mmap lock on:
1. single task anon vmas being expanded and faulted at the same time
2. single task anon vmas being unmapped and faulted at the same time

I think that's it?

But maybe I missed something critical about your use case here?

I don't understand why you are involving anon vmas in this discussion,
so I must have missed something with your IO completion issue.  Is there
an anon vma causing your priority inversion?

But it's only a problem for anon vmas with per-vma locking if it's the
same vma (or the vma lock sequence counter overflows, but let's say
that's a statistically insignificant non-zero value).

How much complexity can we remove and maintain the performance, might be
a better question.

This seems unrelated to be above complexity that might be the target of
removal?
