But not an external ABI. It documents specifically how the EFI stub
interfaces with the kernel proper. This might change at any point,
without any obligation whatsoever to remain compatible with the
previous method.

Both the EFI stub and the kernel have precisely one way to access the
platform provided device tree each: the EFI stub uses the config table,
and the kernel proper uses what is passed via X0.

I don't think that should change, whatever we decide wrt passing the EFI
system table pointer. The whole point of the EFI stub is impedance
matching between the EFI loading/calling convention and the Linux/arm64
boot ABI, and so passing the DTB, iff received via a EFI config table, on
to the kernel in register X0 is literally its purpose in life.

It would be nice if the EFI stub could pass the pristine DT without
modifying it, so there is less ambiguity about where certain DT
properties came from, but I don't think it justifies deviating from the
above.

Not disagreeing but I think it is fine to leave it as I suggested at this
point.

Some additional work is needed to get rid of linux,uefi-boot-memmap
entirely, and until that happens, passing the EFI system table via
X1 and linux,uefi-boot-memmap via DT is not a huge improvement.

linux,uefi-boot-memmap is needed when SetVirtualAddressMap() is called
[with a non-1:1 mapping], as the EFI system table contains a remapped
address of the config table array in that case.

There are currently two remaining reasons why calling
SetVirtualAddressMap() is required:
- some Ampere boxes crash otherwise (but these systems tolerate SVAM
being called with a 1:1 mapping)
- kernel configs with a VA space < 48 bits are not guaranteed to be
able to map the EFI runtime services 1:1, so there, SVAM is still
needed as well.

Both can be fixed, and I have been meaning to address the latter by
always making the EFI runtime map (which is essentially a 1:1 map)
use 48 bits of VA in all configs. (The ID map already does the same)

Then, the former can be addressed by installing a 1:1 mapping when
calling SVAM.

That would remove the need entirely to ever call SVAM() on arm64,
and therefore the need to pass the address of the EFI memory map
separately.
