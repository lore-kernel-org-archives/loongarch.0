On my 3C5000 Dual-way machine, VM has the same CPU/memory topology with 
physical machine, the kernel is mainline without any patch.
                           ./ebizzy -M
Host (32 pCPUs)           158898
One VM(32 vCPUs)          133153                 83% of host
Two VMs(32 vCPUs each)    9083 + 9630 = 18713    11% of host

It seems that with ebizzy benchmark, there is big difference if vCPU is 
preempted. Even if vCPU is not preempted, the performance is only 83% of 
host on my 3C5000 Dual-way machine.
