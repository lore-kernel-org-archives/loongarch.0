Sorry for that.

This is indeed something I had overlooked -- thank you for catching it. It
is a correctness issue, not just a performance one, so it has to gate the
feature.

I understand the race exactly as you describe it. With software PTW, a
TLB miss runs the guest's refill handler with interrupts disabled, and
that handler may already have loaded the old PTE into a register. A
native remote flush sends an IPI, but the IPI is held until IE is
re-enabled, so the flush always lands *after* the refill completes -- any
stale entry the refill wrote gets purged. The PV path breaks this: the
host flushes the target's TLB (drops the VPID) at an arbitrary instant,
then the target resumes its disabled refill handler and writes the stale
entry back with tlbfill/tlbwr, and nothing flushes it afterwards. The
same applies to the steal-time variant if a vCPU is preempted mid-refill:
it is flushed on re-entry and then resumes the refill. Only a hardware
PTW is safe, because the refill is atomic and always reads the current
table.

So the feature must only be offered when the guest actually uses a
hardware PTW. The real condition is on the *guest* -- a -cpu la464 guest
still does software refill even on a PTW host -- so the host gate alone
is not enough; a non-PTW guest must not observe the feature either.

For the host side, cpu_has_ptw is the natural precondition, and there's
already a precedent in kvm_vm_init_features() where
KVM_LOONGARCH_VM_FEAT_PTW is gated on cpu_has_ptw. I'd wrap the
advertisement the same way:

    if (cpu_has_ptw) {
        kvm->arch.pv_features  |= BIT(KVM_FEATURE_PV_TLB_FLUSH);
        kvm->arch.kvm_features |= BIT(KVM_LOONGARCH_VM_FEAT_PV_TLB_FLUSH);
    }

For the guest side: the guest discovers the feature by reading the
CPUCFG_KVM_FEATURE leaf, so if feasible I'd mask KVM_FEATURE_PV_TLB_FLUSH
off right there -- in kvm_emu_cpucfg() (the CPUCFG_KVM_FEATURE case in
exit.c) and the matching one_reg getter kvm_loongarch_cpucfg_get_attr()
in vcpu.c -- whenever the guest's own CPUCFG2.PTW (vcpu->arch.cpucfg[2],
bit 24) is clear. The equivalent could also be done in QEMU alongside
the companion patch, since QEMU already controls the guest model's PTW
bit. Both look implementable; I'll need to actually test them to see how
they behave.

On the hardware side, I checked the box I ran the benchmarks on. It
reports as a 3A6000 / LA664, but reading CPUCFG2 directly gives 0x7e7cccc7
with the PTW bit (24) clear, so it has no hardware PTW either -- likely
an early part. Your 3C5000 is LA464, which is software PTW too. That
means the ebizzy and tlb_bench numbers I shared earlier were collected
with PV TLB flush active on a -cpu la464 (software-refill) guest, i.e.
exactly the unsafe configuration you pointed out. They show the mechanism
works and its direction (hypercall ahead of steal-time, and PV preventing
the overcommit collapse), but they were measured in a correctness-broken
config, so I won't use them to justify enabling the feature on
software-PTW silicon.

For now I don't have a PTW-capable machine to test on. My reading is that
a software-PTW-safe variant isn't really possible -- the native IPI is
safe precisely because the flush is deferred past the IE=0 refill window,
and a host-side flush can't reproduce that ordering without effectively
becoming an IPI again. I'll spend some time confirming that, but
unless I've missed something, gating to hardware-PTW guests is the
answer.

Thanks,
Tao
