Please do it as a separate discussion then - rather than starting a
thread in response to a posting of patches which are _supposed_ to
be being reviewed.

Bringing up issues which are in effect future enhancements without
explicitly stating that they are future enhancements makes it look like
the patch set isn't ready to be merged - and is a distraction to trying
to get the series merged.
