Hi Liam,

I think there may be a misunderstanding about the motivation behind
this series.

Currently, for both file-backed and anonymous VMAs, when a page fault
cannot lock the required folios=E2=80=94for example, because a folio is und=
er
I/O during a major fault=E2=80=94the fault handler drops any locks it is
holding (either per-VMA locks or the mmap lock) and retries the fault
under the mmap_lock. This page-fault retry pattern requiring the
mmap_lock can lead to significant mmap_lock contention.

The entire purpose of this series is to avoid reacquiring the mmap_lock
where possible, while ensuring that the implementation does not
introduce new priority inversion issues or unnecessary complexity.

We have two possible approaches:

1. Keep the page-fault retry path, but retry under the per-VMA lock
whenever possible. In this case, we would need a flag to indicate
whether the retry should be performed under the per-VMA lock or the
mmap_lock.

2. Remove the page-fault retry path entirely. Instead, wait for the
folio to become lockable while retaining the locks currently held,
and continue the fault handling without retrying the page fault.

Approach 1 is the direction taken by both the current patch and the
RFC that was suggested.

Approach 2 is a potential alternative, but I have never posted an RFC
proposing it.

For Approach 1, the primary concern seems to be the added complexity.

For Approach 2, my concern is the increased risk of priority
inversion. With this approach, we may end up holding a lock while
waiting for I/O completion, potentially for a considerable amount of
time. As a result, a concurrent VMA writer, along with any subsequent
mmap_lock acquirers blocked behind it, could be stalled for an
extended period.

If there is an approach 3, it could be:
for file VMAs, we take approach 2; for anonymous VMAs, we take
approach 1.

In terms of fork(), this is the concern I raised when considering
approach 2=E2=80=94holding the VMA lock while performing I/O, since a
concurrent fork would need to acquire the VMA write lock.

I had Hongru add some tracing code and run it against the top 200
Android applications in the China market. All of them are heavily
multi-threaded. Unfortunately, we found that 82 of these 200 Android
applications call fork(), and some even call fork() from multiple
threads.

So, although it may be technically a bad idea to call fork() in a
multi-threaded application, it appears that in practice it is still
widely used in real-world applications.

I guess Hongru (Cc-ed) will share his observations later today or
tomorrow.

Yes and no. It could also include mprotect, UFFDIO_REGISTER,
UFFDIO_UNREGISTER, and setting VMA names, etc.

Note that Java GC may also invoke UFFDIO_REGISTER and
UFFDIO_UNREGISTER on Java heaps.

Note that priority inversion can still occur between threads that are
not operating on the same VMA if we take approach 2.

For example:

Thread A: page fault in vma1, holding the VMA lock and waiting for I/O.

Thread B: concurrent write on vma1 (takes mmap_lock and then waits for
the VMA write lock);

Thread C: concurrent write on vma2 or do VMA iteration (acquires
mmap_lock).

In this scenario, Thread C may end up indirectly waiting for Thread A.

As explained, the primary goal is to reduce mmap_lock contention by
avoiding taking the mmap_lock whenever possible, while ensuring that
the implementation does not introduce new priority inversion issues.

Right, thanks for improving the question.

I think it is highly related. If we take approach 2=E2=80=94holding locks t=
o
perform I/O and removing the page-fault retry path=E2=80=94we need to
consider whether the same behavior should also apply when we are
already holding the mmap_lock. We should understand the full picture
before focusing on a specific part in isolation.

Thanks
Barry
