Thanks for the reference. That makes sense — the 1:1 overhead is
larger on multi-socket systems, so there may be room to improve
even without overcommit.

I'll try to get access to a server-class LoongArch machine for
further testing. If you're able to run the patches on the 3C5000,
that would be great too.
