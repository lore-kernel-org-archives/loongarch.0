I replied further down the thread, but the key point was to maintain
the strong distinction between 'what' was done in a real hotplug
path vs one where onlining was all.  We can relax that but it goes
contrary to the careful dance that was needed to get any agreement
to the ARM architecture aspects of this.

If we combine these, the _STA check is necessary because we will call this
path for delayed onlining of ARM64 CPUs (if the earlier registration code
call or arch_register_cpu() returned -EPROBE defer). That's the only way
we know that a given CPU is online capable but firmware is saying we can't
bring it online yet (it may be be vHP later).

I read that call as
	acpi_map_cpu_for_physical_cpu_hotplug()
but we could make it equivalent of.
	acpi_map_cpu_for_whatever_cpu_hotplug()
(I'm not proposing those names though ;)

in which case it is fine to just stub it out on ARM64.

This one needs more careful handling because we are calling this
for non hotplug cases on arm64 in which case we end up setting this
for initially online CPUs - thus if we offline and online them
again via sysfs /sys/bus/cpu/device/cpuX/online it goes through the
hotplug path and should not.

So I need a way to detect if we are hotplugging the cpu or not.
Is there a standard way to do this?  I haven't figured out how
to use flags in drivers to communicate this state.

That's the bit that I'm currently finding a challenge. Is there a clean
way to detect that?
