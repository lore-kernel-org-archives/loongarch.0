From: WANG Xuerui <git@xen0n.name>

Now the arch code is mostly ready for LLVM/Clang consumption, it is time
to re-organize the CFLAGS a little to actually enable the LLVM build.

In particular, -mexplicit-relocs and -mdirect-extern-access are not
necessary nor supported on Clang; feature detection via cc-option would
not work, because that way the broken combo of "new GNU as + old GCC"
would seem to get "fixed", but actually produce broken kernels.
Explicitly depending on CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG is thus necessary to not
regress UX for those building their own kernels.

A build with !RELOCATABLE && !MODULE is confirmed working within a QEMU
environment; support for the two features are currently blocked on
LLVM/Clang, and will come later.
