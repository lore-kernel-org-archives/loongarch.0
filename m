Yeah, that might be good, let me think a bit about it and discuss in tomorrows

My preference is to keep plane scheduling at one place (in the kernel) to keep
it simple. But if you see a need for user-mode to interact there as well (only
really works for VSM), then I can add it.

I read a bit more about VSM and it seems their prioritization of VTLs is a bit
more complicated. VTL0 has the least privileges but boots first, then sets up
VTL1. But VTL1 is only higher-privileged once it is locked by VTL0. Another way
to look at it is that VTL0 de-prioritizes itself.

The patches here are built around the assumption that plane0 is the highest
privileged one and is always runnable. Running any lower-privilege plane must
be triggered by the guest. This is clearly not sufficient for VSM, the question
is how to solve that.

The answer depends on how IRQ delivery affects VTL scheduling in VSM. If a
VM has VTL0 (currently running), VTL1, and VTL2 (highest privilege), and an IRQ
becomed pending for VTL1, does Hyper-V schedule VTL1 directly or does it switch
to VTL2 (highest privilege) first to let it schedule VTL1?

When VSM switches to VTL2 first, then planes could just use a marker for the
highest-privilege plane (which can be non-zero). In the other case the solution
is likely to make the direction in which the vcpu->common->vcpus[] array is
traversed configurable.
