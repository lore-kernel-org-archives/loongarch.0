I searched on the Internet for a long time last night, but
still couldn't find the source of Ninenine Pi. Can you
provide the origin of the manufacturer's naming? Or transfer
our offline discussion to an online platform.

What are the possible unexpected problems that may be
triggered? For example?

Since 99 has nothing to do with the price, and you think that
the 9 is not used to represent a number, then I'm curious. In
the name of this development board, what does the 9 represent?
Based on my research, I have already clarified that "99" has
the same Chinese pronunciation as "久久 (long time)", so I
think the naming should carry the implication of "lasting
or a long time".

I have research on other similar development boards,
such as Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Mango Pi... The English names
of these development boards all have corresponding meanings.
Why can't we come up with a good name?

Based on the above discussion, I don't accept the name "ninenine Pi" 
which has no implied meaning.

Thanks,
