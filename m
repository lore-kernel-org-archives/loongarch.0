Hi Mike,

Thanks for the review.

> Can you elaborate how ACPI systems filter their reserved memory?

In the EFI memory map, firmware carveouts are reported with the type
EFI_RESERVED_TYPE. This type of memory gets the nomap flag set in
memblock.memory (is_usable_memory() returns false in reserve_regions()
and mark these regions with nomap flag), during prepare_elf_headers(),
for_each_mem_range() filters out these nomap regions. Therefore, the
memory reserved on ACPI based systems will not be dumped into the vmcore.

I will add these description in next version.

You are right, the wording was misleading. Let me clarify what I meant.

In this series only DT marks regions as MEMBLOCK_NODUMP:
/reserved-memory and /memreserve/ entries are tagged in the OF
paths (of_reserved_mem.c, fdt.c). ACPI does not set the flag and
keeps filtering its reserved memory through the existing path, as
described above.


What I intended to convey is that the flag itself lives in memblock
rather than on the DT-only struct reserved_mem, so it is available
for reuse. If an ACPI system ever needed to exclude a firmware-owned
region from the vmcore, it could mark that region with MEMBLOCK_NODUMP
the same way DT does, instead of having to invent a parallel mechanism.
That is a future option, not something this series enables for ACPI
today.

Also will update these description in next verison.

Best regards,
Wandun
