I mean: if someone starts to build a distro for a less-capable LoongArch
processor, (s)he will need an entire user space compiled with -mstrict-
align.  So it would be better to start preparation now.

And it's likely (s)he will either submit a GCC patch to make GCC
enable/disable -mstrict-align based on the -march=3D (--with-arch at
configure time) value, or hack GCC to enable -mstrict-align by default
for the distro.  So I think we'll also need:

  +# kernel for his/her specific hardware.
   KBUILD_CFLAGS +=3D $(call cc-option,-mno-strict-align)
