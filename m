can: Add Loongson CAN-FD controller driver

This commit adds a driver for the CAN-FD controller in Loongson-2K SoCs.
It supports CAN 2.0B and CAN FD with NAPI RX, TX echo, error reporting
and the usual ctrlmodes. It also exposes a 16-bit free-running counter
as hardware RX/TX timestamps.

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message says the driver "exposes the counter as hardware RX/TX
timestamps". loongson_canfd_get_ts_info() also advertises
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_HARDWARE and SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RAW_HARDWARE.

Is that accurate for TX? loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt() takes its stamp
from loongson_canfd_hwts_now(), which reads the free-running counter live
at whatever moment the ISR reaches the buffer. That reading includes IRQ
latency and the time spent scanning the other buffers. The comment in
tx_interrupt() itself says the controller latches no per-frame TX stamp.

Also, loongson_canfd_hwts_anchor() slews tc.nsec by a signed dev >> 3 and
re-initializes it from ktime_get_real_ns() on a half-window deviation.
Can the reported raw hardware timebase step backwards here, even though
the comment above says stamps must stay monotonic?

Should the commit message mention these limitations?

[Severity: Low]
These fields, along with tick_ns and psc above, are written outside
hwts->lock. Only timecounter_init() runs under the lock.

On the bus-off restart path, can_restart()->do_set_mode()->chip_start()->
hwts_setup(), NAPI or the TX IRQ may already have passed the
READ_ONCE(hwts.ready) check. They can then be inside
loongson_canfd_hwts_ts() reading tc.cc->mult, shift and window_ns under
the lock.

Is this a data race on state that is documented as protected by
hwts->lock? On restart the values are usually rewritten with the same
numbers, so in practice this would mostly show up under KCSAN.

[Severity: Low]
The kernel-doc says the reset bit does not self-clear, but this still
polls for up to 10ms waiting for it to clear.

If the comment is right, doesn't every open() and every CAN_MODE_START
restart busy-wait the full 10ms? If the bit does clear, should the
comment be updated?

[Severity: Medium]
What happens when prop_seg alone is larger than REG_BTR_PROP
(GENMASK(6, 0), so at most 127)?

Both bittiming_const tables use tseg1_max = 190. can_fixup_bittiming()
only checks prop_seg + phase_seg1 against tseg1_max. A manual setting
such as "prop-seg 150 phase-seg1 10" is therefore accepted, and
FIELD_PREP(REG_BTR_PROP, 150) masks it to 22 at runtime.

Would the controller then run with a different bit timing than the one
reported to userspace? can_calc_bittiming() never produces these values,
so this needs a manual setting.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but can this branch ever run?

ctrlmode_supported in loongson_canfd_setup_can_priv() includes only
CAN_CTRLMODE_TDC_AUTO, and the netlink code rejects unsupported ctrlmode
bits. In addition, can_calc_tdco() only ever sets TDC_AUTO, and tdc_const
has tdcv_min = tdcv_max = 0.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the kernel-doc does not list the -EAGAIN return.

The TXBHCI comment in loongson_canfd_interrupt() has a similar mismatch.
It refers to "the W1C in tx_interrupt()", but the INT_STAT write is in
the ISR right before the call, not in loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt().

In the final patch of the series, the kernel-doc added to tx_interrupt()
also says "DMADI is never enabled", but chip_start() enables DMADI when
rx_ch exists.

[Severity: Medium]
With the retransmission limit always enabled, doesn't normal (not
one-shot) mode give up after about 16 attempts and mark the buffer
TX_BS_FAIL? loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt() then frees the echo skb and
counts it in tx_dropped.

Without CAN_CTRLMODE_ONE_SHOT, the expected behaviour is unlimited
retransmission until success or bus-off. ctucanfd clears RTRLE in that
case.

A node with no ACK partner would silently lose frames well before it
reaches bus-off. So would a low-priority frame on a busy bus, if
arbitration loss counts as an attempt.

[Severity: Medium]
Can frames be echoed, or even sent, in a different order from the one
they were submitted in?

This always picks the lowest-index free buffer, and
loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt() handles completions in index order 0..7.
Suppose frame A is in buffer 5 and a later frame B goes into buffer 0. If
both complete before one ISR pass, B is echoed before A.

The driver also programs no TX priority or ordering control (only BUFM at
reset), so the order on the wire may differ too.

The CAN stack expects in-order TX and echo; RECV_OWN_MSGS users such as
ISO-TP depend on it. ctucanfd rotates buffer priorities and tracks
head/tail indices for this reason.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this drain stay inside the rejected frame?

When loongson_canfd_rx_hdr_valid() sees RWCNT < 2, it substitutes the
worst-case length of 2 + 16. This loop then reads 16 words no matter what
the 80-byte FIFO actually holds. With RXBAM auto-advance, these reads
could run into the next frames and leave the cursor in the middle of a
frame.

After that, every later "header" would really be payload. Each one would
be rejected and trigger another fixed drain. A payload word pair that
happens to pass loongson_canfd_hdr_plausible() would be delivered as a
bogus frame.

REG_RX_STAT_RXMOF and REG_CMD_RRB are defined but never used. Would a
FIFO flush be a safer way to resync?

Also, loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_fifo() treats RXFRC == 0 with RXE == 0
as non-empty. That means reading can start before any complete frame has
been committed. Is that intended? The FIFO mode code is unchanged in the
final patch of the series.

[Severity: Medium]
Doesn't this clear the CANFD_FDF flag that alloc_canfd_skb() sets?

include/uapi/linux/can.h says CANFD_FDF is set in all CAN FD frame
structures provided by the CAN subsystem. With this assignment, every FD
frame received through this driver reaches userspace without it.

[Severity: Medium]
stats_lock is documented as protecting ndev->stats.
loongson_canfd_rx_overrun_event() (hardirq) and
loongson_canfd_report_bus_error() update rx_packets, rx_bytes, rx_errors
and rx_over_errors under it.

Here in NAPI, the same counters are updated without the lock and with
IRQs enabled. loongson_canfd_rx_note_bad() does the same for rx_dropped,
and so does rx_one_frame_dma*() in the final patch.

Can a DOI interrupt that lands in the middle of this read-modify-write
lose increments? As written, the lock does not seem to protect anything.

[Severity: Medium]
Can the bus-off restart race with the TX IRQ on echo_skb[]?

On bus-off only can_bus_off() is called. CONF_ENA, INT_ENA, NAPI and the
IRQ all stay active, and armed TX buffers are not cancelled.

When restart_ms is set, can_restart() calls can_flush_echo_skb() without
tx_lock. It relies on this comment in drivers/net/can/dev/dev.c:

	/* No synchronization needed because the device is bus-off and
	 * no messages can come in or go out.
	 */

The controller might report TX completions at that moment: FAIL or
CANCEL, or VALID after automatic recovery. In that case
loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt() on another CPU can call can_get_echo_skb()
or can_free_echo_skb() on the same slot.

Could that free an echo skb twice, or pass an already freed skb to
netif_rx()?

do_set_mode()->reset()/chip_start() also rewrites the MODE, CONF and INT
registers and can.state without tx_lock. xmit, NAPI or err_interrupt may
be running at the same time. Whether TXBHCI fires while bus-off depends
on the hardware.

[Severity: Low]
These counters are incremented on every transition into the state,
including improvements such as error-passive to error-warning. The
core's can_update_state_error_stats() counts only escalations:

	if (new_state <= priv->state)
		return;

Should this driver use the same semantics, for example by using
can_change_state()? As written, the IFLA_INFO_XSTATS counters mean
something different for this driver than for others.

[Severity: Medium]
data[1] only carries meaning when CAN_ERR_CRTL is set in can_id. Should
this be CAN_ERR_CRTL | CAN_ERR_CNT, the way can_change_state() does it?
Without the class bit, decoders that check it never see the return to
error-active.

The same function also counts transitions into warning, passive and
bus-off that are improvements, as described in the previous comment.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens on the transition out of BUS_OFF?

Suppose the controller recovers automatically and raises FCSI.
loongson_canfd_report_state_change() then overwrites priv->can.state with
ACTIVE, WARNING or PASSIVE. However, carrier is never turned back on and
the queue is not woken; the driver has no netif_carrier_on() anywhere.

With restart-ms=0, the hardware may be back on the bus sending
still-armed buffers while the interface keeps carrier off. A manual
restart would then fail with -EBUSY, because can_restart_now() checks:

	if (priv->state != CAN_STATE_BUS_OFF)
		return -EBUSY;

Is down/up the only way to recover here?

[Severity: Medium]
BRP comes from the tx_stat snapshot taken before the loop. BS comes from
a separate TX_STAT read inside loongson_canfd_get_txbuf_sts().

The hardware may clear BRP once arbitration is won and update BS only at
the end of the frame. Could a scan during that frame then see BRP clear
and BS idle, and free the echo of a frame that is still on the wire? Such
a scan could be triggered by the previous buffer's completion in a
back-to-back burst.

loongson_canfd_find_free_txbuf() would then hand out the slot.
loongson_canfd_start_xmit() could rewrite that buffer through TX_SEL and
TX_DATA while it is still being transmitted.

Does this build with older compilers? GCC before 11 rejects a
declaration directly after a case label:

  a label can only be part of a statement and a declaration is not a
  statement

Documentation/process/changes.rst lists GCC 8.1 as the minimum, and
CONFIG_CAN_LOONGSON_CANFD depends only on HAS_IOMEM. An allmodconfig
build with GCC 8 to 10 on any architecture would fail here. The final
patch in the series does not change this code. Adding braces around the
case body, or moving the declaration up, would avoid the error.

[Severity: Low]
wake is decided under tx_lock but acted on after the lock is dropped.

In between, loongson_canfd_start_xmit() on another CPU can fill the last
free buffer and call netif_stop_queue(). This would then wake a full
queue, and the next xmit would hit the "No free TX buffer while queue
was awake!" NETDEV_TX_BUSY path. The next completion recovers the queue.

[Severity: Medium]
Does a masked source still latch into INT_STAT on this controller? The
comment depends on that. On CTU CAN FD style IP, which this register
layout resembles, masked interrupts are not captured.

If the same is true here, consider a buffer that completes after
tx_interrupt() has read its BS field but before the unmask. It would
raise no new interrupt. Its echo_skb would stay allocated, and
loongson_canfd_find_free_txbuf() would skip the slot until some unrelated
completion triggers another scan.

If that buffer held the last frame of a burst, could the echo and the
slot stay stuck indefinitely? The DOI path below has the same window.

[Severity: Medium]
The loop in loongson_canfd_interrupt() keeps going while INT_STAT is
non-zero, for up to 10000 iterations. Each iteration does many MMIO
accesses and may allocate error skbs.

loongson_canfd_err_interrupt() unmasks BEI and ALI again on every pass.
With berr-reporting enabled, could a steady stream of bus errors keep
this hardirq loop running up to the limit?

Only RBNEI, TXBHCI, DOI and ERRORI are acknowledged (plus DMADI in the
final patch), so any other INT_STAT bit that is set would also spin to
the limit. loongson_canfd_chip_start() briefly unmasks every source with
REG_INT_MASK_CLR and never W1C-clears stale INT_STAT bits.

On timeout, only the interrupts are disabled. CONF_ENA stays set,
can.state, carrier and the queue are unchanged, and no recovery is
scheduled. Doesn't that leave the controller on the bus with RX and TX
completions never serviced again until ifdown/ifup?

[ ... ]

> +	if (can_dropped_invalid_skb(ndev, skb))
> +		return NETDEV_TX_OK;

[Severity: Medium]
Should this be can_dev_dropped_skb()? can_dropped_invalid_skb() accepts
valid ETH_P_CANXL skbs, and it does not enforce listen-only mode.

loongson_canfd_insert_frame() treats every skb that is not CAN FD as
Classic CAN. For a CAN XL frame, cf->len is really canxl_frame.flags,
which is always >= 0x80 because CANXL_XLF is set. That value then bounds
this loop:

	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < cf->len; i += LOONGSON_CANFD_DW_BYTE) {

The loop reads get_unaligned_le32(cf->data + i) far past the packet data
(skb->len can be as small as 13). It stops only when the regmap write
beyond max_register fails.

That failure then hits the netdev_err() below, which is not rate-limited,
once per packet. A CAP_NET_RAW user can inject such frames through
PF_PACKET. The buffer is never armed, so nothing reaches the bus.

[Severity: Medium]
loongson_canfd_txbuf_freed() treats any buffer with BRP clear as free.
loongson_canfd_find_free_txbuf() also requires BS to be idle and
echo_skb[] to be empty. The queue is stopped here, and woken in
tx_interrupt(), based on the weaker test.

Take a buffer that has just finished: BRP is clear, BS is VALID or FAIL,
and echo_skb is still held until the ISR cleans it up. In that window,
can xmit pass the first check and then return NETDEV_TX_BUSY from the
second one?

Should both checks use the same predicate?

[Severity: High]
Can this read freed memory? cf points into skb->data, and
can_put_echo_skb() always consumes the skb. If skb_clone() fails in
can_create_echo_skb():

	nskb = skb_clone(skb, GFP_ATOMIC);
	if (unlikely(!nskb)) {
		kfree_skb(skb);
		return NULL;
	}

can_put_echo_skb() returns -ENOMEM, which is ignored here. cf->can_id
and cf->len are then read from the freed skb.

IFF_ECHO is always set by this driver, so every transmit goes through
the clone path. The final patch in the series does not change this code.

[Severity: Medium]
tx_bytes is counted at submit time but never taken back. That covers
this failure path and buffers that later end in TX_BS_FAIL or
TX_BS_CANCEL, where only tx_dropped is incremented. tx_packets, on the
other hand, is counted only on TX_BS_VALID.

The length returned by can_get_echo_skb() in
loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt() is discarded into dummy_len. Would
counting tx_bytes there keep tx_bytes and tx_packets consistent?

Separately, loongson_canfd_rx_overrun_event() counts the locally
generated CAN_ERR_CRTL error frame in rx_packets and rx_bytes. CAN
drivers no longer count error frames there.

[Severity: Medium]
Can restart_work be armed again after this cancel? At this point the IRQ
is still registered and enabled.

A bus-off FCSI could arrive before loongson_canfd_chip_stop(). An ISR
could also still be running on another CPU, since there is no
synchronize_irq(). Either one goes through:

err_interrupt()->report_state_change()->can_bus_off()

can_bus_off() schedules restart_work when restart_ms is set.

If that work fires during chip_stop() or free_irq(), can_restart()->
loongson_canfd_do_set_mode(CAN_MODE_START) resets the chip and
re-enables INT_ENA, INT_MASK and CONF_ENA. In the final version of the
series it also restarts the RX DMA. All of this happens after ndo_stop,
with no handler on the IRQF_SHARED line. The later cancel in
close_candev() only waits for a work item that is already running.

Could the unhandled interrupts on the shared line then make the "nobody
cared" logic disable it for the other devices on that line?

[Severity: Low]
Hardware timestamping is advertised here only while hwts.ready is set.
However, ndo_hwtstamp_get/set use can_hwtstamp_get() and
can_hwtstamp_set(), which always report and accept HWTSTAMP_TX_ON and
HWTSTAMP_FILTER_ALL. As a result, ethtool -T and SIOCGHWTSTAMP can
disagree.

hwts.ready is false when the interface is down or when
loongson_canfd_hwts_setup() failed. In that state, can_put_echo_skb()
still sets SKBTX_IN_PROGRESS, and __can_get_echo_skb() still calls
skb_tstamp_tx() with skb_hwtstamps(skb). Wouldn't userspace then receive
a hardware TX timestamp of zero?

[Severity: Low]
Can this check ever reject anything?

REG_FRAME_META0_ID_BASE is GENMASK(28, 18), an 11-bit field. FIELD_GET()
on it returns at most 0x7ff, which equals CAN_SFF_MASK, so the
comparison is always false. Standard-ID headers are never filtered
here.

The kernel-doc describes loongson_canfd_hdr_plausible() as the full
discriminator that stops payload words from being taken as a header.
A dead test weakens that.

Was the intent to require REG_FRAME_META0_ID_EXT (bits 17:0) to be
zero when XDT is clear? If the controller does not guarantee that, the
check should probably be dropped instead.

The & CAN_SFF_MASK applied after the same FIELD_GET() in
loongson_canfd_rx_deliver() is also a no-op.

[Severity: Medium]
The regmap uses REGCACHE_MAPLE, but every register the driver reads
back is listed in loongson_canfd_volatile_reg(), and the cache is
never synced or invalidated. What does the cache provide here?

As configured, it has side effects. The TX buffer window
LOONGSON_CANFD_TX_DATA_1..LOONGSON_CANFD_TX_DATA_18 is writable and
readable but not volatile. Each regmap_write() from
loongson_canfd_insert_frame() therefore goes through
regcache_maple_write() before the MMIO write.

That code runs in loongson_canfd_start_xmit() under tx_lock. The
first write to each offset allocates maple nodes and an entry array
with GFP_ATOMIC, because the MMIO regmap is fast_io. If either
allocation fails, regmap_write() returns -ENOMEM without touching the
hardware, and the frame is dropped with a netdev_err() that is not
rate-limited.

The window is also banked through LOONGSON_CANFD_TX_SEL, so the cache
folds the eight hardware TX buffers into one set of cached values. The
driver never reads them back today. Any later read or
regmap_update_bits() on that range would return another buffer's data.

Several readable counter and status registers are not volatile either:
LOONGSON_CANFD_BRE, LOONGSON_CANFD_RETX_CNT, LOONGSON_CANFD_RX_FR_CNT,
LOONGSON_CANFD_DEBUG, LOONGSON_CANFD_RX_MEM_INFO and
LOONGSON_CANFD_RX_PRT. After the first read they are served from the
cache, so the regmap debugfs registers file shows frozen values.

LOONGSON_CANFD_RX_DATA is readable but has no precious_reg callback.
Reading the debugfs registers file therefore pops a word from the live
RX FIFO. That desynchronizes the header parsing in
loongson_canfd_rx_hdr_valid() for the frame being received.

Would REGCACHE_NONE be simpler here? If the cache is wanted, the TX
window and the counters should be volatile, and RX_DATA should be
marked precious.
