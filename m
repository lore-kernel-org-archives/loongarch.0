After fixing the ebizzy command, I
have multi-VM overcommit results for both approaches.

Setup: 8-core LoongArch (single-socket, single NUMA), KVM,
linux-next-20260623, 8 vCPU per VM. All VMs run ebizzy -M
simultaneously, 3 runs each. The PV-off baseline uses a guest kernel
with CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y but without the PV TLB flush patches, so
PV IPI and steal-time are active in all three columns.

ebizzy -M, total records/s across all VMs:

              PV-off      steal-time   hypercall
  1:1 (1VM)   53,600      53,800       53,900
  2:1 (2VM)    2,600      42,600       45,300
  3:1 (3VM)    2,800      44,700       46,000

At 1:1 there is no difference — no vCPU gets preempted. Under
overcommit, without PV TLB flush the throughput drops to ~3-5% of
the single-VM case, because every remote TLB flush sends IPIs to
preempted vCPUs. With either PV TLB flush variant, preempted vCPUs
are skipped, and total throughput stays at ~85-90% of single-VM
(bounded by physical cores).

Hypercall is consistently 3-6% above steal-time in the overcommit
cases. A possible reason is that the hypercall hands the entire
target set to the host in one call, while steal-time still IPIs the
running vCPUs and only defers the preempted ones.

On our 8-core machine the collapse is more severe than on your
3C5000 (~5% vs 11% of host at 2 VMs), likely due to the smaller
core count and single-NUMA topology.

Tao
