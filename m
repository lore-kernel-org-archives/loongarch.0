=46rom a quick glance that looks good to me.

We'll also need to kick off the spec change with a code-first proposal.
I think current standard way to do that is a bugzilla entry in EDK2 repo=20
https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/buglist.cgi?component=3DSpecification%20Upda=
te&product=3DEDK2%20Code%20First&resolution=3D---
and the get someone in ASWG to create equivalent tracking issue in mantis.

Great if you already have that in hand via relevant ARM folks.
