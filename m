That's an implementation choice of PPC/S390 as I explained before, which
could trivially be solved by having an explicit pt_regs->return_val
member,

I agree it's an invalid syscall, but the current generic entry code made
the rightful assumption that returning -1L as the syscall number either
results in -ENOSYS or in the value which was set by one of the entry
mechanisms as that code originated from the x86 implementation.

It's not the fault of that code that PPC and S390 converted their stuff
over without paying attention to that detail.

That's what I explained you before and you told me I'm all wrong.

But that's moot as this latest version does not care anymore. The
architectures whixh preset the return value are correct under all
circumstances and PPC/S390 can keep their own world view.

Thanks,
