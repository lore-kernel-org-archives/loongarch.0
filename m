I mostly agree with this and have to say that my statement in the cover letter
about plane hierarchies was a bit broad.

The main assumption this patch-set makes about plane 0 is that it is the plane
which does the IRQ scheduling. Say a VM has Plane 0,1, and 2. A VCPU runs plane
2 and KVM wants to inject an IRQ into plane 1 of that VCPU. Now KVM needs the
VCPU to decide whether it wants to run plane 1 to handle the IRQ or continue
with plane 2 because it currently has higher-priority work to do.

This decision is made on plane 0 in this patch-set, which it needs to be for
VMPLs. Does VSM have a similar concept for IRQ scheduling between VTLs or will
the hypervisor take care to run a VTL when it has IRQs?
