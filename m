I looked at the kernel bit.  The vsm/dev branch contains 72 patches
over 6.12 which is quite a lot ...

However, from a quick skim, the main thing is that you used multiple
KVM structures to manage the planes which means each plane naturally
gets its own address space.  In the current planes model so far there's
only one address space (or two if you have SMM).  SNP doesn't need
anything above this because the VMPL protection is naturally managed
inside the guest (so not really visible to the host) but a VTL
implementation will.  So I think the big question becomes how are we
going to achieve address space separation for planes?  It's tempting to
say simply one address space per plane and make SMM its own plane with
different switching but it's an awful lot of overhead especially as
most VMs won't even use planes, so it looks like there has to be a more
opportunistic model for planes address spaces.

I already addressed this in a different reply

https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/570f82e8b8bc968a31a4ba859145f6c324e41247.camel@=
HansenPartnership.com/

but basically I think hierarchical privilege will be too limiting.  I
agree we need to have enough primitives to bring up hierarchical VSMs
if that's what the guest wants (Windows definitely will) but this
shouldn't be the only thing we can arrange planes as.  The mutually
distrusting model has a lot going for it in terms of security
properties.
