"These operations" means "LSX/LASX other operations", except its 
floating-point operations.

"not compatible" is incorrect. If future chips add new features to 
define and use these registers, some bits in CPUCFG should be set, like 
CPUID in X86.

And at that time, if the applications do not use these new features(like 
some old apps), they can run at *default* state which is the same as 
current 3A5000.

So, "reserved" is just to prepare for adding something, not "incompatible".

Thanks.
