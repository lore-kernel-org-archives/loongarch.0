I=E2=80=99m quite sure that swap-in and VMA writes can occur
concurrently, and this is fairly common. For example,
Java GC may use mprotect or userfaultfd on a small
portion of a large Java heap while other portions are
still under do_swap_page().

If we start exploring different approaches for anon and
file, I agree I can revisit this on an Android phone if
there is a real, serious case where a file VMA can be
written and a page fault occurs at the same time.

Please note that, as an Android developer, I am particularly
cautious about priority inversion. A recent issue causing
severe priority inversion is zram attempting to support
preemption[1]. When a task performing compression or
decompression is migrated to another CPU and then preempted
by other tasks, high-priority tasks waiting on the mutex may
be significantly delayed, impacting user experience.

Exactly not. Maybe these slides[2] and this project[3] can give
you a hint=E2=80=94they aim to standardize things on Linux by
learning from Apple OS. Basically, tasks are classified
into five types:

USER_INTERACTIVE: Requires immediate response.
USER_INITIATED: Tolerates a short delay, but must respond quickly still.
UTILITY: Tolerates long delays, but not prolonged ones.
BACKGROUND: Doesn=E2=80=99t mind prolonged delays.
DEFAULT: System default behavior.
