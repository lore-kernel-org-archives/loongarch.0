A major difference in Android apps is that each thread can
affect user experience differently. And it is not simply a matter
of whether a VMA writer has higher or lower priority than a
page-fault (PF) thread performing I/O.

For example, thread A handles a PF; thread B attempts to
modify the VMA where the PF occurs; thread C tries to modify
another VMA (requiring mmap_lock in write mode) or iterate
VMAs (requiring mmap_lock in read mode). Regardless of
thread B=E2=80=99s priority, it holds mmap_lock in write mode while
waiting for the VMA lock. The usual pattern for a VMA writer
is:

mmap_write_lock()
vma_start_write()

As a result, thread C can be blocked even if it has higher
priority but operates on a different VMA.

In essence, when a PF and a VMA write occur concurrently,
high-priority threads may be blocked even if they operate on
different VMAs, not necessarily the same one.
