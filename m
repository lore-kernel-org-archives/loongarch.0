Hi Yu, Sean,

Perhaps I "simplified" this bit of the series a little bit too much.
Being able to opportunistically do aging with KVM (even without
setting the Kconfig) is valuable.

IIUC, we have the following possibilities:
- v4: aging with KVM is done if the new Kconfig is set.
- v3: aging with KVM is always done.
- v2: aging with KVM is done when the architecture reports that it can
probably be done locklessly, set at KVM MMU init time.
- Another possibility?: aging with KVM is only done exactly when it
can be done locklessly (i.e., mmu_notifier_test/clear_young() called
such that it will not grab any locks).

I like the v4 approach because:
1. We can choose whether or not to do aging with KVM no matter what
architecture we're using (without requiring userspace be aware to
disable the feature at runtime with sysfs to avoid regressing
performance if they don't care about proactive reclaim).
2. If we check the new feature bit (0x8) in sysfs, we can know for
sure if aging is meant to be working or not. The selftest changes I
made won't work properly unless there is a way to be sure that aging
is working with KVM.

For look-around at eviction time:
- v4: done if the main mm PTE was young and no MMU notifiers are subscribed=
.
- v2/v3: done if the main mm PTE was young or (the SPTE was young and
the MMU notifier was lockless/fast).

I made this logic change as part of removing batching.

I'd really appreciate guidance on what the correct thing to do is.

In my mind, what would work great is: by default, do aging exactly
when KVM can do it locklessly, and then have a Kconfig to always have
MGLRU to do aging with KVM if a user really cares about proactive
reclaim (when the feature bit is set). The selftest can check the
Kconfig + feature bit to know for sure if aging will be done.

I'm not sure what the exact right thing to do for look-around is.

Thanks for the quick feedback.
