[Severity: High]
With IRQF_SHARED now being used, does se_irq_handler() need to return
IRQ_NONE when it doesn't process any interrupts?

drivers/mfd/loongson-se.c:se_irq_handler() {
...
	/* For engines */
	while (int_status) {
		id = __ffs(int_status);
		complete(&se->engines[id].completion);
		int_status &= ~BIT(id);
		writel(BIT(id), se->base + SE_S2LINT_CL);
	}

	spin_unlock(&se->dev_lock);

	return IRQ_HANDLED;
}

If another device sharing the IRQ line triggers an interrupt and
int_status is 0, the handler will skip processing but unconditionally
return IRQ_HANDLED.

This defeats the spurious interrupt detection mechanism in
note_interrupt(), which could lead to a system lockup if an interrupt
storm occurs on the shared line.



[Severity: Critical]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does se_irq_handler() lack bounds
checking when accessing the engines array?

drivers/mfd/loongson-se.c:se_irq_handler() {
...
	/* For engines */
	while (int_status) {
		id = __ffs(int_status);
		complete(&se->engines[id].completion);
...

The driver enables all 32 possible interrupts by writing SE_INT_ALL
(0xffffffff) to SE_S2LINT_EN in loongson_se_probe(). The engines array
has a fixed size of SE_ENGINE_MAX (16).

If the hardware sets any interrupt bit from 16 to 31, id will be >= 16,
resulting in an out-of-bounds memory write when calling complete().
Could this corrupt adjacent heap memory?



[Severity: Critical]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but is it safe to use
devm_kmalloc() with GFP_KERNEL here instead of devm_kzalloc()?

drivers/mfd/loongson-se.c:loongson_se_probe() {
...
	se = devm_kmalloc(dev, sizeof(*se), GFP_KERNEL);
...
	writel(SE_INT_ALL, se->base + SE_S2LINT_EN);
...
	err = devm_request_irq(dev, irq, se_irq_handler, IRQF_SHARED, "loongson-se", se);
...

The se->engines array contains uninitialized garbage because it is
allocated with devm_kmalloc(). Hardware interrupts are globally enabled
and the IRQ handler is registered before the engine completions are
initialized.

If a leftover interrupt from a prior hardware state is pending when the
handler registers, se_irq_handler() could execute
complete(&se->engines[id].completion) on random, uninitialized memory.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but should the probe function return an
error if devm_request_irq() fails?

If devm_request_irq() fails, the loop continues without returning an
error code. Immediately after, loongson_se_init() issues a hardware
command and calls wait_for_completion_interruptible(&se->cmd_completion).

Since no interrupt handler is registered to signal complete(), the
worker thread executing the probe will hang indefinitely.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but is a reinit_completion()
needed before waiting on the completions?

drivers/mfd/loongson-se.c:loongson_se_send_engine_cmd() {
...
	return wait_for_completion_interruptible(&engine->completion);
}

If a user process executing this is interrupted by a signal, it returns
-ERESTARTSYS immediately while the hardware command continues executing.
When the hardware eventually finishes, the interrupt handler calls
complete(), incrementing the completion counter.

Because reinit_completion() is never called before initiating the next
command, the subsequent wait_for_completion_interruptible() will
immediately return success before the new hardware command has actually
finished, breaking hardware synchronization.



[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does loongson_se_init() write
uninitialized stack memory to the device registers?

drivers/mfd/loongson-se.c:loongson_se_init() {
	struct loongson_se_controller_cmd cmd;
	int err;

	cmd.command_id = SE_CMD_START;
	err = loongson_se_send_controller_cmd(se, &cmd);
...

For SE_CMD_START, only cmd.command_id is initialized, leaving the
cmd.info array uninitialized. loongson_se_send_controller_cmd() then
unconditionally writes SE_SEND_CMD_REG_LEN (8) u32 words to the device
via writel().

This writes 28 bytes of uninitialized kernel stack contents directly to
the device MMIO registers.



[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does the platform driver
declaration lack a .remove callback to properly halt the hardware?

drivers/mfd/loongson-se.c:
...
static struct platform_driver loongson_se_driver = {
	.probe   = loongson_se_probe,
	.driver  = {
		.name  = "loongson-se",
		.acpi_match_table = loongson_se_acpi_match,
	},
};

During driver unbind or module removal, devres will automatically free
the DMA buffer and the IRQ. Because there is no explicit teardown step
to send a stop command or disable hardware interrupts, the controller
remains fully active.

If the hardware continues to process and writes to the now-freed DMA
memory, could it cause memory corruption or trigger IOMMU faults?
