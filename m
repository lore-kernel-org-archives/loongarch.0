Thanks for your reviews.

It does not fix any failed testcases, the testcases passed without
and with this patch. It only affects the output for some testcases
such as test_verifier 14, 153, 190, 191, 193, 197, 200, 201, 202,
204, 255, 256, 295, 297, 298, 300, 301, 302, 307, 308, 331, 341,
342, 475, 477, 500, 512, 514, 515, 517, 520, 522, 523, 525.

For example, for the test_verifier 14,
verifier/atomic_cmpxchg.c:215
"Dest pointer in r0 - succeed, check 5",
if remove ".flags = F_NEEDS_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS,",
here is the test result if HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS is not set:

$ sudo ./test_verifier 14
#14/u Dest pointer in r0 - succeed, check 5 OK
#14/p Dest pointer in r0 - succeed, check 5 FAIL
Unexpected verifier log!
EXP: R0 invalid mem access
RES:
FAIL
Unexpected error message!
	EXP: R0 invalid mem access
	RES: misaligned access off (0x0; 0xffffffff)+-8 size 4
verification time 27 usec
stack depth 8
processed 5 insns (limit 1000000) max_states_per_insn 0 total_states 0 
peak_states 0 mark_read 0

misaligned access off (0x0; 0xffffffff)+-8 size 4
verification time 27 usec
stack depth 8
processed 5 insns (limit 1000000) max_states_per_insn 0 total_states 0 
peak_states 0 mark_read 0
Summary: 1 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED

It seems that this is because the program has unaligned accesses,
but the kernel sets CONFIG_ARCH_STRICT_ALIGN by default to enable
-mstrict-align to prevent unaligned accesses.

So I think add "(NOTE: not executed due to unknown alignment)" to the
output is reasonable. Something I missed?

Without this patch:

   sudo ./test_verifier > log.before

With this patch:

   sudo ./test_verifier > log.after
