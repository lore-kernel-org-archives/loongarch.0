It's customary to accompany "performance-related" changes like this with 
some benchmark numbers and concrete use cases where this would be 
profitable. Especially given that arch/loongarch developer and user base 
is relatively small, we probably don't want to allow customization of 
such a low-level characteristic. In general kernel performance does not 
vary much with compiler flags like this, so I'd really hope to see some 
numbers here to convince people that this is *really* providing gains.

Also, defaulting to emitting unaligned accesses would mean those future, 
likely embedded models (and AFAIK some existing models that haven't 
reached GA yet) would lose support with the defconfig. Which means 
downstream packagers that care about those use cases would have one more 
non-default, non-generic option to carry within their Kconfig. We 
probably don't want to repeat the history of other architectures (think 
arch/arm or arch/mips) where there wasn't really generic builds and 
board-specific tweaks proliferated.
