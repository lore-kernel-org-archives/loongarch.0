can: loongson_canfd: Add RXDMA support

This patch adds optional RX DMA support to the Loongson CAN-FD driver.
When an "rx" DMA channel is present, a cyclic DMA transfer moves frames
into a 32 KiB coherent ring, and the driver parses them from there
through new per-mode callbacks. Otherwise it uses the existing FIFO poll
path. The patch also reworks NAPI completion and adds handling for the
DMADI interrupt.

> When an "rx" DMA channel is available, incoming frames are moved into
> a ring buffer by a cyclic DMA transfer and read directly from there,
> reducing MMIO accesses and improving RX throughput under high traffic.

[Severity: Low]
Is the "reducing MMIO accesses" claim accurate for classic CAN frames?
Counting per frame in DMA mode:

loongson_canfd_rx_napi()
  loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma()
    loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr() -> dmaengine_tx_status()
        (provider spinlock, CCR and CNDTR reads)
    regmap_read(RX_STAT)
  loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma()
    loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr() -> dmaengine_tx_status()
        (spinlock, two more MMIO reads)

That comes to about five MMIO reads and two spinlock round trips per
frame. An 8-byte classic frame in FIFO mode costs about the same: RX_STAT,
two header words and two payload words. DMADI also adds a per-message
interrupt.

Are there measurements that could go into the commit message?

> The DMA path is fully transparent to the networking stack; the driver
> falls back to FIFO polling when no DMA channel is present.

[Severity: Low]
This reads as if FIFO mode is unchanged. However,
loongson_canfd_rx_napi_done() is rewritten for both modes.

With rx_ch == NULL it now calls loongson_canfd_rx_overrun_event() from
NAPI context and does an extra RX_STAT read. When RXFRC != 0 or RXE is
clear, it calls napi_schedule() instead of unmasking RBNEI. Before this
patch it only unmasked RBNEI.

Could the commit message mention this change to the FIFO path?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the description doesn't match the code.
rx_bad_cnt is only incremented after loongson_canfd_rx_deliver() returns
-ENOMEM, and every invalid-header path resets it to 0.

The same goes for loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma(). Its kernel-doc says
-ENODATA means "a run of malformed frames was detected", but it is
returned for a single zero or unresolvable header. Its -ENOMEM path also
returns 1 ("one frame consumed") while advancing only one word.

Could the documentation be updated to match?

[Severity: Medium]
Any status other than DMA_IN_PROGRESS returns silently, so a channel
fault looks the same as "no progress yet". For example, the CMC provider
only logs a TEI with dev_err() and never completes the cookie.

If the channel stops moving data, nothing reads RX_DATA over MMIO in DMA
mode. The FIFO then stays non-empty while rx_wr_pos stays frozen:

loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma()    returns false (RXFRC > 0)
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma()   returns -EAGAIN
loongson_canfd_rx_napi_done()
	/* FIFO still holds data: keep NAPI scheduled, RBNEI stays masked */
	napi_schedule(napi);

Is there a way to recover RX in this state? As written, NAPI seems to
reschedule itself forever on one CPU.

[Severity: Medium]
Each sample can only add between 0 and RXDMA_NUM - 1 words. Suppose the
cyclic DMA writes RXDMA_NUM words or more between two samples, for
example because NAPI was delayed by about 32 KiB of bus traffic. Then
rx_wr_pos is undercounted by a multiple of the ring size, and exactly one
lap looks like no progress at all.

In that case, can the avail > LOONGSON_CANFD_RXDMA_NUM overrun check in
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma() ever fire? Without it, overwritten slots
get parsed with the wrong frame alignment.

When an overrun is detected, loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_overrun()
does:

	priv->rx_rd_pos = priv->rx_wr_pos - LOONGSON_CANFD_RXDMA_NUM + 2;

That puts the reader only two words ahead of the next DMA write slot, and
not on a frame boundary.

[Severity: Medium]
This treats any backward step of off as a full wrap, which assumes the
residue is exact and monotonic.

loongson2-apb-cmc-dma never sets ddev->residue_granularity, so it reports
DMA_RESIDUE_GRANULARITY_DESCRIPTOR. loongson_canfd_rxdma_setup() doesn't
check dma_get_slave_caps() before choosing DMA mode.

The provider's residue also mixes the live CNDTR with the software
next_sg, and next_sg only advances in its IRQ handler:

	ndtr = loongson2_cmc_dma_read(lddev, LOONGSON2_CMCDMA_CNDTR, lchan->id);
	residue = ndtr << width;
	...
	for (i = next_sg; i < desc->num_sgs; i++)
		residue += desc->sg_req[i].len;

If CNDTR reloads at terminal count, a sample taken between TC and the IRQ
comes out one period too large. Would that be treated as a wrap here,
pushing rx_wr_pos ahead by about 7168 words?

FIFO mode reads RX_DATA through regmap-mmio, which uses readl() and
converts from little-endian. Here the same words come from the ring as a
native unsigned int, with no le32_to_cpu().

On a big-endian kernel, would the DMA path see byte-swapped headers and
payload compared with the FIFO path? CAN_LOONGSON_CANFD only depends on
HAS_IOMEM.

The same applies to loongson_canfd_ring_peek() and the direct
rx_cpu_buf[] reads in loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma().

[Severity: Medium]
Should this buffer be allocated against the DMA controller, using
dmaengine_get_dma_device(priv->rx_ch), rather than ndev->dev.parent?

The CMC engine is the device that writes the ring, and its CMAR/CPAR
registers are only 32 bits wide. The driver never limits the DMA mask to
match. If the CAN node's DMA mask, dma-ranges or IOMMU setup differs from
the controller's, could the engine write to a truncated or wrong address?

loongson_canfd_rxdma_free() would need the same change.

[Severity: Medium]
With buf_len at 32 KiB and period_len at 4 KiB, loongson2-apb-cmc-dma
doesn't use hardware circular mode, because it only sets CCR_CIRC when
buf_len == period_len. Instead it builds 8 sg entries and advances them
from its channel IRQ handler: it clears CCR_EN, writes CMAR, then sets
CCR_EN again.

So at every 4 KiB boundary, for the whole TC-to-IRQ latency, the channel
either isn't servicing the CAN DMA request or is still writing to the old
CMAR. The RX FIFO is only 80 bytes. Can one FD frame arriving in that gap
overflow it?

No callback is installed, so the per-period DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT doesn't
seem to be needed. Would a single 8192-item period, which is under the
64K item limit, select true circular mode instead?

[Severity: High]
Can desc be an ERR_PTR here? loongson2_cmc_dma_prep_dma_cyclic() is the
provider named in MODULE_SOFTDEP, and it returns ERR_PTR on failure:

	desc = kzalloc_flex(*desc, sg_req, num_periods, GFP_NOWAIT);
	if (!desc)
		return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);

An ERR_PTR passes the !desc check, and dmaengine_submit() then
dereferences desc->tx_submit. This path runs from ndo_open, and from
do_set_mode(CAN_MODE_START) in the bus-off restart work.

Would IS_ERR_OR_NULL() be the right check here?

[Severity: Medium]
This comment implies the engine can produce zero-fill while the
controller is disabled. If so, only the zeros written before this one
sync are skipped. Zeros written between here and chip_start() setting
REG_CONF_ENA would stay in the ring.

The first real frame would then land behind those zeros.
loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma() or loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_bad_hdr()
would see a zero header and do:

	priv->rx_rd_pos = priv->rx_wr_pos;

Could that silently drop the first frames after an open or a restart?

Also, loongson_canfd_do_set_mode() calls loongson_canfd_reset() before
loongson_canfd_rxdma_stop(). That soft-resets the controller while its
DMA is still reading RX_DATA. Is that ordering intended?

[Severity: Medium]
do_set_mode(CAN_MODE_START) is reached from can_restart(), through either
the restart work or a netlink restart. At that point NAPI is still
enabled and may be polling. What serializes this against
loongson_canfd_rx_napi()?

loongson_canfd_rxdma_start() resets rx_rd_pos, rx_wr_pos, rx_wr_off and
rx_cookie with plain stores. Meanwhile the poll may be inside
loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr(), or rolling rx_rd_pos back to a saved_rd_pos
taken before the restart. Between terminate and resubmit, the old cookie
can also report residue 0, which loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr() reads as a
wrap.

can_restart() assumes nothing is in flight during bus-off. Here, though,
err_state_change() neither stops the chip nor disables NAPI, and NAPI may
still be rescheduling itself. Could either interleaving leave rx_wr_pos
permanently offset from the real DMA position?

[Severity: High]
loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma() runs before process_rx() on every
iteration of loongson_canfd_rx_napi(). Once the FIFO has drained
(RXFRC == 0, RXE set), any zero or implausible word pair at rx_rd_pos
makes it set rx_rd_pos = rx_wr_pos and return true. That discards
every unread word in the ring, up to the full 32 KiB, and no counter
is updated.

This seems to defeat the recovery paths in
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma().
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_overrun() moves rx_rd_pos to
rx_wr_pos - RXDMA_NUM + 2 and returns 0, expecting the next iteration
to resync through loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_bad_hdr(). That
position is almost never a frame boundary.

If the FIFO is empty on the next iteration, the implausible pair is
seen here first and the whole ring is dropped. The forward scan in
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_bad_hdr() never gets to run.

This function also never checks whether rx_wr_pos - rx_rd_pos exceeds
RXDMA_NUM. An overrun that is first noticed here is therefore dropped
silently, and rx_over_errors and rx_errors are never incremented.

Zero words sitting ahead of real frames behave the same way. This path
and both zero-header branches in
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_bad_hdr() realign on rx_wr_pos. Any
valid frames the DMA has already written behind the zeros are lost as
well.

Should loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma() only report emptiness and
leave resynchronization to process_rx()? And should these discards be
counted somewhere, for example in rx_dropped?

[Severity: High]
Doesn't this also return false in the normal drained state, where
wr == rd and the FIFO is idle? No path returns true for wr == rd.

If so, every NAPI poll ends by running LOONGSON_CANFD_DMA_WAIT_RETRY_MAX
(100) -EAGAIN iterations in loongson_canfd_rx_napi(). Each iteration does
a dmaengine_tx_status() call and an RX_STAT read.

The same check also makes NAPI reschedule forever on a quiet bus when the
tail of the ring can't be consumed:

- wr - rd == 1, for example after the -ENOMEM path below.

- A resync lands on a plausible header whose payload never arrives, so
  loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma() keeps rolling back:

	if (priv->rx_wr_pos - priv->rx_rd_pos < d.rwcnt - 2) {
		priv->rx_rd_pos = saved_rd_pos;
		return -EAGAIN;
	}

In both cases loongson_canfd_rx_napi_done() sees wr > rd and calls
napi_schedule() with no limit. Is there a timeout or fallback meant to
stop this?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but dbg_state and dbg_rx_stat are read here and never
used, and the avail parameter is unused too. Can these be dropped?

The kernel-doc also says this resyncs "on the oldest still-valid word".
However, rx_wr_pos - RXDMA_NUM + 2 isn't a frame boundary, so the next
parse goes through the bad-header scan.

[Severity: Low]
Neither this warning nor the "RX pointer inversion" warning in
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma() is rate limited. Both run from NAPI,
and bus flooding can trigger them. Should they use net_ratelimit(), as
the existing hardware overrun handler does?

[ ... ]

[Severity: Low]
This rx_dropped++ doesn't take stats_lock. Neither does the -ENOMEM path
in loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma(), nor loongson_canfd_rx_note_bad().
On the other hand, loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_overrun() and the
pointer-inversion branch take stats_lock for the same counter.

All of these run in NAPI context. The unlocked updates only lose
increments if two polls overlap, which the rx_napi_done() window
described below makes possible. Could one scheme be used consistently?

[Severity: Medium]
The words scanned here are usually payload bytes sent by a remote node.
Once the reader has lost alignment, any word pair that passes
loongson_canfd_hdr_plausible() is accepted as a header. Alignment can be
lost through the -ENOMEM path's saved_rd_pos + 1, an overrun resync, or
the pointer races.

Could a remote node embed a plausible header in a frame's data? Once the
reader is desynchronized, the host would deliver a frame with an ID and
data that were never sent on the bus. That could get around ID-based
filtering done upstream, for example at a gateway.

[Severity: High]
loongson_canfd_rx_deliver() returns -ENOMEM before reading any payload,
so rx_rd_pos is saved_rd_pos + 2 at this point. Setting it to
saved_rd_pos + 1 leaves the reader on hdr1 of a frame that was already
validated.

Should this skip the whole frame instead? The FIFO path does that with
loongson_canfd_rx_note_bad(ndev, d.rwcnt).

Take a 2-word frame (RTR, or classic with DLC=0) at the tail of the ring.
After this path rd = saved + 1 and wr = saved + 2:

loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma()
	if (priv->rx_wr_pos < priv->rx_rd_pos + 2)
		return false;
loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma()
	if (avail < 2)
		return -EAGAIN;
loongson_canfd_rx_napi()
	100 cpu_relax() retries, then completes
loongson_canfd_rx_napi_done()
	if (priv->rx_wr_pos > priv->rx_rd_pos) {
		napi_schedule(napi);

Can this keep one CPU spinning in softirq, with RBNEI still masked, until
another frame arrives?

For longer frames, (hdr1, payload0) gets parsed as the next header.
Depending on FIFO state, that either discards the whole ring in
loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma() or sends the reader into the payload
scan in loongson_canfd_rx_one_frame_dma_bad_hdr().

Also, rx_bad_cnt is reset to 0 on the valid-header path just above. Can
the ++priv->rx_bad_cnt >= 64 bail-out ever fire?

[Severity: High]
NAPI ownership has already been released by napi_complete_done() at this
point. DMADI is never masked and fires for every message. Can an
interrupt on another CPU, or preemption on PREEMPT_RT, start a second
poll in this window? That poll would run
loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma() -> loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr() at the
same time as this code.

loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr() does an unlocked read-modify-write:

	if (off < priv->rx_wr_off)
		priv->rx_wr_pos += LOONGSON_CANFD_RXDMA_NUM -
				   priv->rx_wr_off + off;
	else
		priv->rx_wr_pos += off - priv->rx_wr_off;

	priv->rx_wr_off = off;

If both contexts compute the delta from the same old rx_wr_off, the delta
gets added twice. rx_wr_pos would then stay ahead of the real DMA
position. Would stale ring contents from the previous lap be parsed as
new frames until the next restart?

[Severity: Medium]
The order of these checks seems to leave a window. The ring is sampled
first through loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr(). Then
loongson_canfd_rx_overrun_event() and the RX_STAT read run, and only
after that is RBNEI unmasked.

Suppose a frame is still in the hardware FIFO when
loongson_canfd_dma_sync_wr() runs, so rx_wr_pos == rx_rd_pos. The DMA
engine keeps running and can move that frame into the ring before
RX_STAT is read. RX_STAT then shows RXFRC == 0 with RXE set, so RBNEI
is unmasked and the function returns.

The FIFO is already empty by then, so no empty -> non-empty edge will
follow. rx_wr_pos is not sampled again after the unmask.

A frame of 8 to 72 bytes doesn't cross a 4 KiB period boundary. If
DMADI only fires once per period, as the new chip_start() comment
says, nothing reschedules NAPI. Wouldn't that frame sit unread in the
ring until the next frame arrives on the bus?

Would it work to read RX_STAT and unmask RBNEI first, and only then
re-sync rx_wr_pos and reschedule if rx_wr_pos > rx_rd_pos? Or does
DMADI really fire for every message, which would cover this case?

[Severity: Low]
loongson_canfd_rx_overrun_event() now also runs here in softirq, as well
as from the hardirq DOI handler. The ISR masks DOI around its own call,
but that doesn't exclude this caller.

If both read the sticky DOR bit before either one writes REG_CMD_CDO,
would a single overrun be counted twice in rx_over_errors and rx_errors,
and produce two CAN_ERR_CRTL_RX_OVERFLOW frames? The handler is only
idempotent for sequential calls.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but this comment doesn't match the code.
loongson_canfd_tx_interrupt() doesn't touch RBNEI or the DMA channel.
chip_start() enables DMADI, the ISR handles DMADI, and there is no
pause/resume.

A few other comments also disagree with the code or with each other:

- loongson_canfd_rxdma_start() and loongson_canfd_rx_is_empty_dma() say
  the engine stalls on an empty RX_DATA. Yet there are several "DMA
  zero-fill" recovery paths, and rxdma_start() skips zero-fill.

- The kernel-doc of loongson_canfd_rx_overrun_event() and its "Hard IRQ:
  use netif_rx()" comment still describe a hard-IRQ-only caller.
  loongson_canfd_rx_napi_done() now also calls it from NAPI.

REG_INT_STAT_DMADI is described as the "Message DMA Transfer Complete
Interrupt", so it looks like a per-message event. Unlike RBNEI, it is
never masked while NAPI is running.

Under high traffic, does this raise a hardware IRQ for every received
frame even while NAPI is polling? That would work against NAPI interrupt
mitigation.

The comment added to loongson_canfd_chip_start() says DMADI fires "once
per cyclic period", which doesn't seem to match.
