I know it is the same for compilers, I mean the current way gives more
information for humans.

In addition, without reg02, this piece completely has no relationship
with CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, so please drop it.

I don't think so. CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK decouples TP
(thread_info) and SP (stack), but doesn't decouple SP and THREAD_SIZE,
even for the VMAP_STACK case. This is from RISC-V:

#ifdef CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
#define THREAD_ALIGN            (2 * THREAD_SIZE)
#else
#define THREAD_ALIGN            THREAD_SIZE
#endif

Stack is still aligned to THREAD_SIZE.

Do you have performance data for the two cases?

PowerPC, PA-RISC, ARM32 and UML are the latest archs that support
THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.

PowerPC in 5.1:
ed1cd6deb013a11959d17a94e35ce159197632da powerpc: Activate
CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.

PA-RISC in 5.16:
2214c0e77259b420402e279e9ab4277ef320d371 parisc: Move thread_info into
task struct.

ARM32 in 5.16:
18ed1c01a7dd3d7c780b06a49124da237a4c1790 ARM: smp: Enable THREAD_INFO_IN_TA=
SK.

UML in 6.13:
2f681ba4b352cdd5658ed2a96062375a12839755 um: move thread info into task.

None of these commits remove current_pt_regs. Some of them has no
current_pt_regs before THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, and ARM32 still has its
own implementations in arch/arm/include/asm/ptrace.h now which is
nearly the same as LoongArch.

Frankly, I completely don't know what you are doing when I see
"__entry_task" for the first time. Then I see the UML naming and I
know everything immediately.

ARM64 introduces "__entry_task" and in
18ed1c01a7dd3d7c780b06a49124da237a4c1790 ARM32 follows it, and ARM32
only has __entry_task, but no entry_task_switch.

So you can think this naming is a only case rather than a common case.

As said before, UML is the latest one that introduces
CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK,  "cpu_tasks" is not a "historical style",
and x86 uses "current_task" rather than "__entry_task". Both
"cpu_tasks" and "current_task" are better than "__entry_task".

set_current() is a very good friend of get_current(). Though "$tp" is
enough for get_current(), from the x86 implementation we know that it
can also get from the per-cpu array (but suboptimal).

Move set_current() to current.h also don't need to include
<linux/percpu.h> and <linux/sched.h>, it only need to forwarding
declare "task_struct" and include <asm/percpu.h>, which is exactly
done in the x86 implementation.

And you needn't worry about the compiling, I have tested before I comment.
