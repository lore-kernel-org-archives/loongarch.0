Thank all of you. :)

As Rui and Xuerui said, ll and sc in LoongArch both have implicit full
barriers, so there is no "relaxed" version.

The __WEAK_LLSC_MB in __cmpxchg_small() have nothing to do with ll and
 sc themselves, we need a barrier at the branch target just because
Loongson-3A5000 has a hardware flaw (and will be fixed in
Loongson-3A6000).

qspinlock just needs xchg_small(), but cmpxchg_small() is also useful
for percpu operations. So I plan to split this patch to two: the first
add xchg_small() and cmpxchg_small(), the second enable qspinlock.
