I'm not really sure how the above is related to the actual patch.

It is unclear what exactly is meant by "CPUs described as packages".

From the patch, it looks like those would be Processor() objects
defined under a processor container device.

Discovered like what?

The above requires clarification too.

Why is the reference counting needed here?

Wouldn't acpi_fetch_acpi_dev() suffice?

Also, should the walk really be terminated on the first error?

This covers processor objects only, so why is this not needed for
processor devices defined under a processor container object?

It is not obvious, so it would be nice to add a comment explaining the
difference.
