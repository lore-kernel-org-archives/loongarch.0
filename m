Hi Huacai,

Thanks a lot for pointing this out!

Actually, I haven't stopped working on this patch series; rather, I've
been continuously refining it. During the process of perfecting this
feature, I realized that making it fully robust is no small feat. As a
result, I have been iteratively polishing it in my own local tree. You
can find my current progress here [1].

I did notice that Dongtai went ahead and sent out a version of this series.
However, as pointed out by other reviewers, that patchset still has some
issues—which is quite understandable given the complexity.

Out of caution, and since I personally feel this feature is not extremely
urgent for the LoongArch architecture, I previously chose not to send a
"half-baked" version to the mailing list. Livepatching (KLP) involves
far too many corner cases. That is also why I remained quiet while Dongtai
was iterating on his version.

Furthermore, to avoid any unnecessary conflicts, I have just updated my
patchset [1] to attribute the overlapping parts to Dongtai (setting him
as the author), while keeping my original commit titles and messages.

I believe we can slow down the pace a bit and give everyone enough room
to get things right the first time, which is much better than rushing it.

Lastly, my apologies for not keeping everyone updated on my work earlier.

Thanks,
WangYuli
