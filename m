There is no "Co-developed-by: Yuli Wang" in v2 and v3, right?

Whether it is a fork is not important, the most important thing is
that his klp-build patches appeared in the maillist first.

That's great, later is better than never. I hope the final version is
a complete and elegant one, and reflects both of your efforts.
