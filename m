I'll send v3 shortly.  It drops the dmsintc single-load patch, and the
CTRL_INIT patch now checks s->device.ops for repeated initialization
instead of the separate has_init flag.  pch_pic_base is still updated
only after successful bus registration, and the original registration
error is returned instead of -EFAULT.

Thanks for the review.
