I mean, it's the instinctive move when you dig into all this again :) my eyes!
Burn it all down etc.

BUT. The other thing that came to mind was 'fix this bloody mess!'.

And I also worry with this patch that we might end up deferring NECESSARY work
to do that.

Yes. YES YES YES.

I was thinking honestly I'd look at this patch and come to the conclusion that
yes it is this simple and now I'm going to have to argue with mm people but
fine.

But no, I was just reminded how bloody complicated it all is.

Right yeah.

It does feel like we should just have

Yeah me also.

The 2 fundamental issues with uffd (aside from code quality) is that:

a. It's the exception to a lot of rules
b. It duplicates its own logic

Similar to hugetlb.

And these problems grow as we add more functionality to mm.

I fear the device private stuff is becoming this a bit (albeit, not as bad).

Oh lord. So it's... worse? :)

1st rule of LLMs is they can always hallucinate/get things terrible wrong.

But yeah this was me being lazy but in my defence it was nearly 7pm and I was
still at the office with a long drive ahead of me ;)

I think we probably need more flags, honestly. 'Retry' is too vague.

But on the other hand do we want a flag for every possible weird specific caes?

OK OK I'll wait for Prague for the simplification :)

Yup as above, instinct to nuke from orbit etc. ;) but something (TM) needs to be
done.

Right, yeah.

It does feel like there's a solution lurking here in the undergrowth, so again
Prague etc. etc.

That's definitely part of the solution!

No worries ;)

Though I do have to ask again - do we want this patch as-is as a temporary
solution? Or maybe just for x86/arm64 (god I hate the duplication of the arch
code)

I'm not sure that it does all that much harm?

It's not necessary either/or it can be an and. But I'd want your OK on taking
this.
