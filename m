I'm fine with MEMBLOCK_NODUMP.
The issue Sashiko raised about bound check against cmem->max_nr_ranges
seems valid. 

I didn't check the reserved mem one.

I believe that should be rebased to account for reserved memory changes.
The riscv change from resources to memblock needs an Ack from riscv
maintainers.

And with all that I can take the next version via kexec tree.
